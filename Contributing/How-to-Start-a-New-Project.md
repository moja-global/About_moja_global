## Start a new Project

moja global is increasingly looking for new scientists, developers and researchers to join us and help improve our processes. We are also looking to collaborate on the development of new projects that serve our strategic plan and mission. Please have a look at the following steps to start a new project:

1.  Avoid Duplication:

    -   Before starting a new project, review whether a project based on your idea already exists:
        -   All projects are listed in the **Project** tab of the moja global root directory.
        -   Please also review the existing repositories, as not all may be listed under the "Project" tab.
        -   Finally, have a look at the [Strategic Plan](../Governance/STRATEGIC-PLANS.md) for this year, if your idea might be worked upon.
    -   If your project idea already exists, please join forces with those already active. Else (if your project does not exist) proceed with the next step.    

2.  Build on what already exists:

    -   If you can build on code that is already available, coordinate your project with the maintainers of the relevant repository by [requesting a new feature](https://github.com/moja-global/.github/blob/master/Contributing/How-to-Request-a-New-Feature.md).
    -   If there is no existing code base to start from, [create a repository](https://github.com/moja-global/.github/blob/master/Contributing/How-To-Create-a-Repository.md) even if you are not part of the moja global organisation (yet).

3.  Create a project board to track and update your work:

    -   If you are a part of the moja organisation use the project list under `.github`. 
    -   If you are not (yet) part of the moja global organisation, use the projects list in your repository. You can notify the wider moja global community by opening an issue under `.github` informing that you have started a new project.

4.  Invite your team:

    -   [Invite your team](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-organization-members-to-a-team) to join the project even [if they are not part of the moja global organisation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-outside-collaborators-to-repositories-in-your-organization)
    -   [Nest your team](https://help.github.com/en/articles/moving-a-team-in-your-organizations-hierarchy) into the right parent team, which means the repository team for new projects or the moja-global team for new repositories   
    -   Assign roles for Scientists, Engineers, Editors, Maintainers (for code and science). Try to have at least 2 persons for each role to avoid overloading your team. 

5.  Build a **Science Design**:
    -   If your project has any scientific component, you will need to have a **Science Design** for your project. 
    -   If your project is revising or adding to an existing module, the original **Science Design** can be revised. 
    -   [Follow these steps](https://github.com/moja-global/.github/blob/master/Contributing/How-to-Agree-on-a-Science-Design.md): The processes for both developing new or revising existing **Science Designs** are the same.
6.  Follow the [regular project implementation cycle](How-to-Implement-a-Project.md)
