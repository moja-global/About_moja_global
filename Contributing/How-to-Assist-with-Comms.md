## Contribute to Communication and Outreach:

moja global supports new contributors and people willing to help simplify our processes and workflow. If you would like to help us with communication and outreach tasks, please have a look at the following points to get started:

1.  A project cannot communicate enough. Reaching out to new users or existing collaborators is crucial through various channels.
2.  If you have experience and want to help, please send us an email at [info@moja.global](mailto:info@moja.global). 
3.  Use a clear and descriptive title.
4.  Please provide background or references to prove your good intentions if you do not have a track record on GitHub.
5.  Attach files, screenshots and/or animated GIFs to illustrate your ideas and plans.
6.  Please allow a few days for moja global to reply.
