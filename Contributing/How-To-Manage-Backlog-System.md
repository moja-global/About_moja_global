## The moja Backlog system

The moja Backlog system is designed to be a simple system to manage the backlog of bugs and features.
Two github tools are used to manage the backlog, 'Issues' and 'Projects'. 

Issues are used for managing bugs associated with existing code or for requesting feature enhancements within existing repositories. To create a new bug to add to the backlog see [How-To-Report-Bugs](https://github.com/moja-global/About-moja-global/blob/master/Contributing/How-to-Report-Bugs.md). To create a new feature request se [How-To-Request-a-New-Feature](https://github.com/moja-global/About-moja-global/blob/master/Contributing/How-to-Request-a-New-Feature.md)

Projects are used where the feature (or completely new functionality) being proposed is best implemented as a new repository. An example might be a new FLINT module. For tips on setting up a new project see [How-To-Start-a-New-Project](https://github.com/moja-global/About-moja-global/blob/master/Contributing/How-to-Start-a-New-Project.md)

The backlog for any particular repository is managed by one or mulptiple Maintainers. The role of the Maintainer is to:

1. Review and accept proposed changes to the repository they are responsible for
2. Add new issues for bugs and features for the repository where identified (Contributors should also add issues for bugs and features)
3. If useful, coordinate Maintainer meetings to prioritise issues and projects.

Maintainers should set up the ‘watch’ capacity for projects that they manage to ensure that they are aware of anything that is occurring in the project. It is also recommended that they ‘star’ the relevant pages of the project while they are working as the maintainer.
