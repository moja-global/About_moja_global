## Translations   

moja global wants to reach as many people as possible including those who do not speak English well.   
This is our approach to translations:  

1. User Interface
    * Please contact the Maintainer of the User Interface Repo
    * More info will be made available when the User Interface is more advanced

1. Wiki and user info  
    * moja global wants all info to be available in all languages BUT maintaining information across various languages is hard and time consuming.  
    * Please use the `Translate` function available through your browser to translate pages on GitHub or the Website.  
    * Please advise on how we can facilitate contributions from those who are not comfortable in English
