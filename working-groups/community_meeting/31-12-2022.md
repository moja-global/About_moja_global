## Agenda
Ideas on flint.cloud by Freeman Oparaocha.

## Discussion
- Freeman started with giving a brief introduction about [FLINT.Cloud](https://github.com/moja-global/FLINT.Cloud), he also mentioned that this [repo](https://moja-global.github.io/Handbook/) is very useful for understanding FLINT.Cloud. Overview of the Freeman's idea is to have separate classes for input files, class files, disturbances, and all the functions associated will be encapsulated inside those classes. Also the static or the same input which is required to run the FLINT.Cloud will no longer be there and users can play around with different set of inputs.

- Samyak shared the blocker which he was facing in this [issue](https://github.com/moja-global/community-website/issues/351) to which he was pointed in the right direction.

- Meenal showed her interest in contributing to documentation of Moja Global to which Namya shared these [repo1](https://docs.moja.global/en/master/) [repo2](https://moja-global.github.io/Handbook/).

- Karan pointed out that one of his pull request needs to be reviewed.
