# Preparing GCBM-FLINT data

This document provides workflow considerations for spatially explicit modelling of forest carbon budgets using the Generic Carbon Budget Model (GCBM) and FLINT (Full Lands INtegration Tool). It provides a clear overview of how the historic and projection data can be best prepared as input into the GCBM/FLINT.

This document is important to understand projections as basically, the automation of this preparation process provides the conceptual basis for the FLINT projections approach.
