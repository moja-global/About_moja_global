# Projections of GHG emissions and removals using FLINT

FLINT Users have indicated that the ability to make projections is an essential feature. While it is already possible to run projections with the FLINT as it is a model based system, the approaches to make projections need to be continuously improved to make it easier to generate ever more complex projections.

This repository includes evaluations of different approaches and ideas for additional steps and tests necessary to improve FLINTâ€™s projections capability.
