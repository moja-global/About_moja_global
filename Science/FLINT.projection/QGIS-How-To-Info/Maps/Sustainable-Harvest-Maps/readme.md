These maps were produced following the [process explained for the projection of a sustainable harvest scenario](https://github.com/moja-global/FLINT.Projections/blob/master/Science/QGIS-How-To-Info/How%20to%20Develop%20Sustainable%20Harvest%20Maps.pdf) and the results are discussed in the [map-based projections document](https://github.com/moja-global/FLINT.Projections/blob/master/Science/Projections%20using%20FLINT%20V100.pdf)
